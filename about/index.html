    <h1>Two Factor Authentication</h1>
    <p>
      <em>TwoFactorAuth.org</em> is a website that lists a number of popular
      web services, and whether or not they support <a href=
      "#whatisit">two-factor authentication</a>. TwoFactorAuth.org aims to
      encourage the use of two-factor authentication by making it easier to track
      which websites use two-factor authentication, and how two-factor
      authentication can be enabled.

      <h1>What is two-factor authentication?</h1>
      <p>
        Two-factor authentication is a web-oriented security technology that
        helps to ensure you, and only you, can access a particular web-based
        service. This is done by verifying you have access to some form of
        personal device before logging in. <em>Two-factor</em> authentication
        refers to the factors that are available to confirm your identity upon
        login. Typically, these factors include:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Something you <em>know</em>, such as a password</li>
          <li>Something you <em>have or own</em>, such as a mobile phone</li>
          <li>and occasionally, something you <em>are</em>, such as a
            fingerprint</li>
        </ol>
      </p>

      <h1>How do I use it?</h1>
      <p>
        Two-factor authentication can be set up with many of the online
        accounts you already use. All that is needed is a mobile device, such as
        a smartphone or tablet. Most web services allow you to begin setting up
        two-factor authentication from the account settings page. If you don't
        have a mobile device able to support a two-factor authentication app,
        separate hardware options are often available.

        A list of websites that support two-factor authentication can be found below.

      <h1>What does it protect against?</h1>
      <p>
        A common misconception is that two-factor authentication is a catch-all
        solution to any security issues involving passwords. This is not the
        case. Two-factor authentication can help protect against a number of
        threats, but it is important to remain vigilant and take reasonable
        security precautions whenever possible.

        Here are some situations where two-factor authentication is very
        helpful:
        <ul>
          <li>
            I accidentally clicked on a phishing email, and somebody on the
            other side of the world is trying to login to my account
            with my password.
          </li>
          <li>
            My favorite website didn't secure their databases well enough, and
            the contents of their databases have now been dumped online for
            anybody to see.
          </li>
        </ul>

        Here are some situations where two-factor authentication isn't so
        helpful:
        <ul>
          <li>
            One of my devices has a virus (Attackers that have access to your
            devices through a virus can find ways to bypass two-factor
            authentication).
          </li>
          <li>
            I entered my two-factor authentication token into a sophisticated
            website that aims to fraudulently access my account.
          </li>
        </ul>
